# Archived Documentation

These documents are historical working files that have been superseded by the Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) in `docs/adr/`.

## Archived Files

| File | Superseded By | Notes |
|------|---------------|-------|
| `PERFORMANCE_PLAN.md` | ADR-006, ADR-007 | Original optimization roadmap |
| `PERFORMANCE_PLAN_V2.md` | ADR-006, ADR-007 | Updated with profiling analysis |
| `PERFORMANCE_COMPARISON.md` | `BENCHMARK_RESULTS.md` | Early comparison document |
| `PLAN.md` | Various ADRs | Implementation plan for feedback |

## Why Archived?

The ADRs provide:
- **Living decision logs** that evolve with the codebase
- **Standardized format** (Context, Decision, Consequences)
- **Implementation status tracking**
- **Cross-references** between related decisions

These archived documents contain useful historical context but are no longer actively maintained.

## See Instead

- `docs/adr/` - Architecture Decision Records
- `BENCHMARK_RESULTS.md` - Current performance results
- `CLAUDE.md` - Development guidelines
